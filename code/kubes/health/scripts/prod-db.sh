# Run a command with a tunnel open to the prod health-db.
#
# Opens an SSH-forwarded connection to the prod MariaDB and exports the
# env a health-sync CLI needs — DB_HOST/PORT/USER/PASSWORD/NAME,
# NC_CLIENT_ID/SECRET, NC_BASE_URL, TZ=UTC — pulled live from the
# running pod. Then runs the given command and tears the tunnel down.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/prod-db.sh node dist/cli/analyze-day.js 2026-05-15 pippijn Europe/London
#   scripts/prod-db.sh node dist/cli/golden-check.js
#   scripts/prod-db.sh node /tmp/some-diagnostic.mjs
#
# The command runs locally against 127.0.0.1:13306 -(ssh)-
# svc/health-db:3306. Build the project yourself first if the command
# needs dist/. TZ is pinned to UTC so a local run matches prod (the
# classification pipeline is not timezone-pure).
#
# Wrapper chatter goes to stderr, so the command's stdout stays clean.
# The shebang pulls ssh / node via nix-shell — same pattern as
# scripts/deploy.sh.
