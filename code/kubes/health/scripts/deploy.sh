# Node for `npm run verify` is sourced per-command from the default
# channel's nodejs_24 (24.16+, see VERIFY_NODE below). The Angular 22
# frontend build hard-requires Node >= 24.15; the default channel now
# ships 24.16, so no special channel pin is needed (it briefly required
# nixos-26.05 in 2026-06 when the default was 24.14). git/git-crypt/gh
# come from the shebang's default-channel nix-shell.
# (2026-06-29 Angular 21->22 + zoneless migration; Node 22->24.)
#
# Runs `npm run verify` (typecheck + lint + tests), then the local
# fixture gates (`npm run golden` + `npm run walk-gate` — these can
# only run here, the fixtures are gitignored), commits the
# staged-or-stageable changes under `code/kubes/health/`, pushes
# to main, waits for CI, then rolls out the new image on isis.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/deploy.sh -m "commit message"
#   scripts/deploy.sh -F /path/to/message.txt
#
# The shebang pulls in git / git-crypt / nodejs / gh via nix-shell so
# you can run the script directly on macOS without a manual wrapper.
# Same pattern as ~/Code/xinutec-infra/mac-mini/fleet_health.py.
