# Proposals

Active design proposals for health-sync. Each is a substantial change
to architecture or pipeline that's worth thinking through before
writing code.

When a proposal lands in code (becomes "shipped" rather than
"proposed"): either summarise the relevant outcomes into
`docs/design/` and delete the proposal, or move the proposal to
`archive/` and link to the design doc that describes the shipped
result. Pick one — don't leave a "this happened" proposal cluttering
this directory.

When a proposal is superseded or paused: move it to `archive/` with
the `status` frontmatter updated.
