/**
 * Playwright UI-render checks — NOT a behavioural suite. They render pages in a
 * real browser at true phone geometry and assert measurable facts about the
 * pixels (no text overlaps, nothing overflows the width). jsdom has no fonts or
 * layout, so a collision that reads fine in source only shows in the render.
 * Shared checkers live in code/kubes/ui-harness; see
 * dev-lint/docs/layout-quality-architecture.md.
 *
 * Runs against the PRODUCTION build served statically by e2e/serve.mjs — one
 * device, identical to life/fleetwatch/messages. `npm run ui-check` (wired into
 * verify.sh after `ng build`) serves the freshly-built dist; reuseExistingServer
 * attaches to a serve.mjs already up. Both the dashboard layout harness
 * (e2e/ui-pages.spec.ts) and the settings overlap spec (e2e/settings.spec.ts)
 * run here — this app has no dev-serve-dependent behavioural specs.
