/**
 * Per-state emission log-likelihood for the MVP HMM.
 *
 * `p(O_t | s) = p_gps_present(present | s)
 *              · p_speed(speed | s)
 *              · p_hr(hr | s)
 *              · p_cadence(cadence | s)`
 *
 * Conditional independence across modalities is an assumption — the
 * HMM design (`docs/archive/2025-model-hmm.md`) calls this out as
 * adequate in practice. State already encodes the latent cause, so
 * the modalities are correlated only via state. Cross-modality
 * correlation (e.g. GPS-absent ↔ HR-still-present in a tunnel) is
 * captured by the state-specific Bernoulli `p_gps_present(s)`.
 *
 * Per-mode prior calibration (hand-tuned for MVP; mixture emissions
 * and EM-fit per-state distributions are post-MVP per the proposal
 * "what MVP defers" list):
 *
 *   - **stationary**: speed ~ 0 (σ=2), HR ~ 70 (σ=15), cadence ~ 0
 *     (zero-inflated). GPS-present probability 0.95 (rare missing
 *     fixes when sitting outdoors with the phone).
 *   - **walking**: speed ~ 5 (σ=2), HR ~ 100 (σ=20), cadence ~ 100
 *     (σ=25). GPS-present 0.95.
 *   - **cycling**: speed ~ 18 (σ=6), HR ~ 130 (σ=20), cadence ~ 0
 *     (zero-inflated). GPS-present 0.95.
 *   - **driving**: speed ~ 40 (σ=20), HR ~ 75 (σ=15), cadence = 0.
 *     GPS-present 0.9.
 *   - **train**: speed ~ 50 (σ=30), HR ~ 75 (σ=15), cadence = 0.
 *     GPS-present 0.3 (often in tunnels; the LOW present-prob is
 *     the disambiguating signal vs driving for the Met-Line-under-
 *     Euston-Underpass case).
 *   - **plane**: speed ~ 600 (σ=200), HR ~ 70 (σ=15), cadence = 0.
 *     GPS-present 0.7.
 *   - **unknown**: uniform-ish very-low priors — explicitly weaker
 *     than any positive-evidence state. Used as a backstop so the
 *     decoder never falls through to NaN; in practice rarely the
 *     MAP because positive-evidence states always score higher.
 *
 * Missing biometric inputs (null) skip that factor — they don't
 * penalise. This matches the "Fitbit on charger" case: HR missing
 * shouldn't make walking less likely.
 *
 * Pure function. Place / line geometry terms (p(gps_lat,lon | place)
 * + p(gps | line)) are post-MVP — wired at integration time when
 * the per-place coordinates and per-line geometry are available.
