/**
 * Per-minute mode-class lock — physical-fact filter for the
 * constraint-first decoder
 * (`docs/proposals/2026-05-constraint-first-decoder.md`).
 *
 * Three locks, all derived from sustained signal aggregated across
 * a window so single-minute noise can't flip the verdict:
 *
 *   "foot"       — watch reports sustained cadence above the walking
 *                  threshold. Feet are moving in the user's reference
 *                  frame; the user cannot simultaneously be in a
 *                  moving vehicle.
 *   "vehicle"    — GPS displacement across the window implies a
 *                  speed above the walking ceiling AND no sustained
 *                  cadence. The user is moving but not on foot
 *                  (train / drive / cycle — the lock doesn't pick
 *                  between them; the scorer does).
 *   "stationary" — GPS observations cluster tightly across the
 *                  window AND no sustained cadence.
 *   null         — the lock is silent; the scorer is free to decide.
 *
 * Thresholds are universal human-physiology / GPS-noise constants,
 * not user-specific. A human cannot sustain > 12 km/h walking; > 30
 * spm wrist cadence sustained is walking; an 80 m cluster spread is
 * within consumer GPS noise for "didn't move."
 *
 * The decoder uses these locks as HARD constraints on segment
 * emission: a `train`/`driving`/`cycling` segment that contains
 * any "foot" or "stationary" minute is rejected; a `walking`
 * segment containing any "vehicle" minute is rejected; etc.
 * That's the structural filter that physical facts must enforce.
 *
 * Pure module.
