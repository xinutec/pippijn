/**
 * Train-generator soft prior — Phase 1 of `docs/proposals/
 * 2026-06-decoder-owns-mode.md` (see also `2026-06-phase1-train-softprior.md`).
 *
 * Turns the structural `(board, line, alight)` candidates from
 * `enumerateTrainCandidates` into a **per-segment entry prior** over
 * `train @ L` states, plus a coverage predicate that gates the per-minute
 * line factors off where this prior is authoritative.
 *
 * Why an *entry* prior (once per segment), not a per-minute emission:
 * a train segment's line is one commitment for the whole ride, and the
 * decode splits a segment wherever the per-minute line changes — so a
 * per-minute boost could flip lines mid-ride. The line decision belongs
 * at the segment boundary.
 *
 * Why *soft* (a calibrated nat, not ±∞): the generator needs a station
 * within ~250 m of the board/alight GPS context, which sparse post-tube
 * GPS can miss for a *real* ride. A hard filter would zero that real
 * train out; the soft prior strongly favours valid triples and never
 * forbids a train the generator missed (those minutes fall through to the
 * per-minute factors, which stay live off-window).
 *
 * Pure module. No DB, no IO, no globals.
