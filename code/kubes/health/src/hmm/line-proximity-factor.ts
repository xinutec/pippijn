/**
 * Per-line GPS-distance factor.
 *
 * Complements `route-rail-evidence` (which fires only at GPS-NULL
 * minutes during a tube tunnel gap). This factor fires at
 * GPS-PRESENT minutes, scoring `train @ L` by whether the observed
 * GPS fix sits on L's track corridor in the route graph.
 *
 * Why both:
 *   - Route-rail-evidence: structural — "are the bookends near
 *     underground L?" Catches tube rides during the GPS gap.
 *   - Line-proximity-factor: continuous — "is THIS minute's fix
 *     near L's track?" Catches everything else (surface rail, the
 *     GPS-present minutes inside a tube ride, mode-continuation
 *     errors where HSMM stays on the wrong line because per-minute
 *     evidence doesn't discriminate).
 *
 * Decision shape per minute:
 *   - L not present in the graph at all: 0 (we don't punish a line
 *     we can't see)
 *   - L's edges within NEAR_M of GPS: boost (+)
 *   - L modeled but NOT within NEAR_M: penalty (−)
 *
 * The earlier two-radius design (NEAR_M / FAR_M) left a dead zone
 * between 250m and 1000m. At urban interchanges that dead zone
 * covered the wrong-line case — e.g. Bond St mid-Jubilee-ride sees
 * Met track ~600m north (on Marylebone Rd) and so paid no penalty
 * for staying on a wrong Met segment. Collapsing to a single tight
 * radius forces a per-minute verdict.
 *
 * Pure with respect to the route graph; per-minute cache keyed off
 * coarse GPS coords.
