/**
 * Per-mode segment-duration distributions for the HSMM.
 *
 * A duration distribution `P_d(d | mode)` answers "given the
 * decoder has chosen `mode` as the state for this run, what's
 * the prior probability the run lasts `d` minutes?" It's the
 * factor that lets the HSMM penalise physically-impossible short
 * segments (a 1-minute plane flight, a 1-minute train ride
 * between two stationary stays) without breaking the Markov
 * structure that Viterbi-like inference relies on.
 *
 * Model: Gamma distribution per mode, fit via method-of-moments
 * on training-day segment durations. The Gamma family is right-
 * skewed positive, matches the empirical shape of dwell-time
 * distributions, and has a simple closed-form fit.
 *
 * Physical-floor override: for each mode, durations below
 * `minDuration(mode)` get a hard-floor log-probability — they're
 * physically implausible regardless of what the fitted Gamma
 * would say. The Gamma fit alone doesn't reliably zero out short
 * durations when its mean is large (Gamma(α=4, β=4/30) at d=1
 * is non-trivially non-zero), so the explicit floor is needed.
 *
 * Pure module. No DB, no IO, no globals.

 *  Plane: hard 30-min floor — short hops are wheels-up to
 *  wheels-down 30-45 min, and the HSMM sees them stripped of
 *  boarding stationary.
 *
 *  Per-place overrides (e.g. stationary @ Home min=10 because
 *  drive-by GPS noise isn't a home visit) are layered on top
 *  at integration time by the HSMM caller.
