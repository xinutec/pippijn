/**
 * Bridge: HSMM `decoded_days` segments → heuristic pipeline
 * `EnrichedSegment[]` place override.
 *
 * The heuristic pipeline is good at segment shape (boundaries,
 * way names, biometric joins) but its place attribution can drift
 * — multiple focus places within the OSM cluster radius, brief
 * stop near a POI being labelled as that POI, etc. The HSMM (as of
 * 2026-05-25, after the entry-prior + visit-frequency + mode-prior
 * fixes) scores 96.4% place attribution against ground truth vs
 * 100% (over a narrow denominator) for the pipeline.
 *
 * This module applies the HSMM's place picks to the pipeline's
 * stationary segments: for each pipeline stationary segment, find
 * the HSMM-dominant focus_place across the segment's minutes and
 * override the segment's display name. The pipeline's other fields
 * (`mode`, `wayName`, biometrics, `city`, etc.) are unchanged.
 *
 * Defensive defaults — the override is conservative:
 *   - Only stationary pipeline segments are considered.
 *   - HSMM must agree the user is stationary AND name a known
 *     focus_place AND that place must have a display name.
 *   - Off-network HSMM (`placeId=null`) leaves the pipeline label
 *     intact.
 *   - HSMM-thinks-the-user-is-walking-but-pipeline-says-stationary
 *     leaves the segment alone (avoid contradicting pipeline on
 *     mode-level disagreements; mode is a separate concern).
 *
 * Pure function. No DB, no IO, no globals.

 * route-graph connectivity + station proximity, which in dense central
 * London can credit a line a road vehicle merely drove past (2026-05-25:
 * a taxi home → Cleveland Clinic mislabelled "Circle Line" because the
 * loop passes within ~600 m of half of zone 1). Against that we weigh the
 * GPS evidence — how much of the trace runs nearer a drivable road than
 * any rail. Neither side is absolute:
 *
 *   - `lineOverlapFraction` — the HSMM's temporal support for the line
 *     (1.0 = it calls the whole segment this train; low = a sliver).
 *   - `roadCorridorFraction` — the share of GPS samples road-nearest
 *     (1.0 = follows roads throughout, no rail anywhere; null = no
 *     samples, e.g. an underground gap the HSMM reconstructed — then
 *     the GPS can't contradict and the HSMM stands).
 *
 * The override fires when the HSMM's line support outweighs the trace's
 * road-following: `lineOverlapFraction > roadCorridorFraction`. A
 * confident line over a rail-consistent trace still wins (real trains);
 * a thin line over a road-hugging trace loses (the taxi). Because OSM
 * rail coverage is fallible, a strong enough HSMM signal can always
 * overcome it — that is the point of weighing rather than vetoing.
