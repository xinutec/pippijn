/**
 * Backfill helpers for per-day intraday sync streams.
 *
 * Each Fitbit intraday data type (HR, steps, future: HRV, …) tracks its
 * own historical coverage independently. A stream is a small descriptor
 * that names the data type, knows how to fetch one day, optionally knows
 * how to skip days quickly, and an orchestrator (`sync.ts`) walks the
 * stream backwards day-by-day, persisting per-stream cursor and
 * completion state in `sync_state`.
 *
 * Why per-stream and not one shared cursor:
 *   - Adding a new stream (today: steps; tomorrow: HRV intraday) doesn't
 *     require rewinding everything else.
 *   - Each stream may have a different historical depth — Fitbit kept
 *     HR longer than steps for some users.
 *   - Completion is well-defined per type: HR-empty for 14 days doesn't
 *     mean steps are done, and vice versa.
 *
 * The two helpers below are the *day-level* primitives. The stream-level
 * orchestration (cursor, empty-day streak, completion flag) lives in
 * `sync.ts` because it needs the runtime FitbitClient + DB connection.
 *
 * Day-level: distinguish three outcomes:
 *   - "ok, this day really has no data" → advance the empty-day streak;
 *     after enough consecutive empty days the stream is marked complete.
 *   - "ok, this day has N>0 data points" → reset the streak.
 *   - "the call threw" → do NOT advance the streak. A transient Fitbit
 *     5xx, network blip, or auth-refresh hiccup is a retry opportunity,
 *     not evidence that the day is empty. Conflating the two used to
 *     silently truncate history after 14 consecutive failures.
