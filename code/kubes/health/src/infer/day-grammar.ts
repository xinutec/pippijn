/**
 * The grammar of a physically-possible day.
 *
 * This is the first load-bearing piece of the joint day-inference rebuild
 * (`docs/proposals/` — "infer the whole day jointly"). It formalises the HARD
 * laws a reconstructed day must obey — the ones whose violation is not "low
 * probability" but "impossible" — as a pure checker over the rendered
 * `DayState[]` timeline.
 *
 * It earns its keep three ways, all from this one definition:
 *   1. **Measurement.** Counting violations across the corpus is the objective
 *      the rebuild drives to zero — "how often does the pipeline emit a day
 *      that couldn't have happened?" (see `cli/score-constraints.ts`).
 *   2. **Grammar.** These same predicates become the zero-probability
 *      transitions of the joint decoder: a trajectory that violates one is
 *      never decoded, no matter how well each piece fits its sensors.
 *   3. **Critic.** A final pass can reject or flag any candidate day (cascade
 *      or decoder) that breaks a law — the "plausibility critic".
 *
 * Each law here is deliberately conservative: it fires only on a genuine
 * physical/resource impossibility, never on a merely-unusual day. Soft
 * implausibilities (a school as a 5-minute errand) belong in the probabilistic
 * scoring, not here.
 *
 * Pure; no DB, no IO.
