/**
 * Persist Google Health weigh-ins into the `body` table (#260).
 *
 * Google gives real, sparse, timestamped weigh-ins. The legacy Fitbit feed
 * gave a forward-filled daily series — which froze at 67.5 kg in Apr 2026 when
 * the Hume → Fitbit path died, hiding the true 64.7–68.3 range. So for the
 * window Google covers we REPLACE the stale Fitbit rows with the real
 * measurements: delete body rows on/after the earliest Google weigh-in, then
 * insert the deduped real values. Rows before that window (older Fitbit
 * history) are left untouched.
