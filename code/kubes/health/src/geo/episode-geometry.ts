/**
 * Episode geometry — the map's half of the "one day, two renderers"
 * model. See `docs/design/episode-geometry.md`.
 *
 * The "your day" narrative renders the smoothed `DayState[]` sequence;
 * the map used to render the raw `EnrichedSegment[]` separately, so the
 * two drifted (a sub-state segment the narrative folded away still drew
 * on the map). `buildEpisodes` resolves a display geometry for each
 * `DayState`, 1:1, so both views render the same episode sequence.
 *
 * Pure: no DB, no network, no side effects. Computed inside
 * `computeVelocityFromInputs`, so it is cached with the rest of the
 * velocity result (one `getVelocityCached` entry). Geometry is strictly
 * downstream of classification and never feeds back — depiction never
 * re-decides what happened.
 *
 * The motivating fix is the per-mode SPEED-PLAUSIBILITY FILTER: a raw
 * moving episode drops fixes whose speed exceeds the physical ceiling
 * for its mode (`MAX_SPEED_FOR_MODE`). A 60 km/h fix inside a `walking`
 * episode is a neighbouring fast mode bleeding across an early segment
 * boundary — it is not walking, and the map will not draw it as walking.
 * This is the display analogue of constraint C2.
