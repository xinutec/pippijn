/**
 * Annotate walking segments with a pavement-matched geometry — the pedestrian
 * analogue of `annotateRoadMatches` (#261), the proper fix for walks cutting
 * across buildings (#265 / `map-constrained-positioning`).
 *
 * Without it the map draws a walking leg as its raw GPS, which on house-lined
 * residential streets sits ~10-30 m off the pavement, clipping the houses. This
 * pass reads the OSM walkable network around each walk (through the `OsmAdapter`,
 * so it records/replays deterministically like the rail/road/bus passes) and runs
 * the pedestrian matcher (`pedestrian-match.ts`) to snap the leg onto the
 * pavement/footway network. The result is attached as `walkMatchedPath`;
 * `episode-geometry` draws it as `kind:"matched"`, above the raw track.
 *
 * Purely additive: never rewrites mode or fixes, only adds display geometry. The
 * matcher's honest `null` (off-network / fragmented graph) leaves
 * `walkMatchedPath` undefined and the raw track draws instead.
