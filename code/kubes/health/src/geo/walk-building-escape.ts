/**
 * Building-escape walk corrector — the explicit, case-based reconstruction of a
 * drawn walk line so it stops running through houses
 * (`docs/proposals/2026-07-continuous-field-walk-reconstruction.md`).
 *
 * The design (Pippijn's), stated as three cases over the drawn line + the OSM
 * walkable network + building footprints:
 *
 *   1. **A vertex lands inside a building** → move it OUT onto the nearest street
 *      *on that building's side*: escape the nearest wall, then snap to the
 *      nearest walkable way just outside it. Never jumps across the block to a
 *      slightly-nearer far-side street.
 *   2. **The gap between two vertices is implausible** — it crosses a building,
 *      OR it is an *urban block cut*: far off every walkable way in built
 *      surroundings (a chord threading BETWEEN mapped footprints across a block,
 *      which containment alone cannot see) → route the gap along the walkable
 *      streets between the two anchored endpoints and insert those points, so
 *      the line goes *around* the block instead of through it.
 *   3. **No streets nearby** (open ground / forest) → trust the GPS; never move a
 *      vertex when there is no walkable surface to move it onto.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic; geometry in, geometry out, no DB or network.
