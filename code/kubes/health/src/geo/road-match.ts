/**
 * Road map-matching — draw a road-vehicle leg on the streets it drove, not as

 *
 * This is now a thin adapter over the shared {@link matchTrajectory} core
 * (`map-match-core.ts`): it supplies {@link ROAD_PROFILE} — the original road
 * tuning, unchanged — and re-exports the mode-agnostic types and display gate so
 * existing callers (`road-match-annotate.ts`, the eval/score CLIs, the tests)
 * keep their imports. The pedestrian matcher (`pedestrian-match.ts`) is the
 * sibling that supplies `WALK_PROFILE`.
 *
 * See `map-match-core.ts` for the Newson-Krumm HMM algorithm and the honest
 * `null` ("draw the raw fixes") fallback.
