/**
 * `stationsOnLine` — given a named rail line, return the set of
 * stations that line serves.
 *
 * Today's `linesAtPoint` answers the inverse question (which lines
 * run near a given point); the planned HMM hard-zero transition
 * rule "line L cannot serve focus place P" requires the membership
 * direction (which stations does L serve?).
 *
 * The local OSM mirror does not ingest relation members beyond way
 * geometry, so we infer membership from spatial proximity: a station
 * point that lies within `MAX_DIST_M` of any way of the line counts
 * as served. The error mode is over-inclusion (e.g. a station near a
 * passing-but-not-stopping line), not under-inclusion. Acceptable
 * for the HMM hard-zero rule, which uses station-graph membership as
 * a NEGATIVE constraint ("if station S is NOT served by line L, then
 * the transition is impossible"). False positives loosen the
 * constraint (don't apply the hard-zero when we should); false
 * negatives would incorrectly forbid valid transitions. Better to
 * over-include here.
 *
 * Results are cached in-process for `CACHE_TTL_MS`; the underlying
 * osm_lines / osm_points change only when the OSM mirror refreshes,
 * which is much slower than the cache TTL.
