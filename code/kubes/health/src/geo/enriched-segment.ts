/**
 * The pipeline's central segment type.
 *
 * `EnrichedSegment` is the unit every classification pass reads and rewrites:
 * a raw {@link TrackSegment} plus the place / way / mode / biometric / geometry
 * annotations the cascade attaches as it runs. It lives in its own module —
 * rather than in `velocity.ts` where the cascade is orchestrated — so the
 * individual passes (`./passes/*`) can depend on the *shape* of a segment
 * without importing the 2700-line orchestrator (which in turn imports them).
 * That keeps the dependency graph a DAG: passes → enriched-segment, orchestrator
 * → passes, with no back-edge.
 *
 * Types only; no runtime code.
