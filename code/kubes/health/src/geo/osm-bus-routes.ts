/**
 * Parse OSM `route=bus` relations into ordered `BusRoute` stop lists —
 * the mirror-ingestion half of C-bus (`bus-route-match.ts` is the matcher
 * that consumes them). Pure, like `extractLineNames` in `osm.ts`: it takes
 * a decoded Overpass response and returns routes, so the parsing is
 * testable without a network or a database.
 *
 * The expected Overpass query outputs each route relation (ordered
 * members + tags) followed by the relation's member nodes (id + lat/lon +
 * tags):
 *
 *     [out:json][timeout:90];
 *     relation[route=bus]({{bbox}});
 *     out body;
 *     node(r);
 *     out body;
 *
 * A relation's stop sequence is read from its members IN ORDER — that
 * order is the route direction the matcher relies on. OSM models each
 * direction as its own relation, so an outbound and a return route arrive
 * as two `BusRoute`s with opposite stop orders, exactly what the matcher
 * wants.
