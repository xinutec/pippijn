/**
 * Biometric coherence — the per-segment "is the user *actually*
 * sitting at this place, vs moving through it" signal that modulates
 * the magnetic-focus-place pull.
 *
 * See `docs/proposals/2026-06-magnetic-focus-places.md` §2.
 *
 * The coherence $B_s \in [0, 1]$ is high when HR + steps over the
 * segment window are consistent with sitting still (low cadence,
 * resting-range HR) and low when they show movement (steps
 * accumulating, HR elevated). A focus_place's magnet pull is the
 * product of its visit-history magnet strength $M_p$ and the
 * segment's $B_s$: either signal weakening collapses the pull.
 *
 * Designed to be a pure function over the data already loaded for
 * splitStaysOnEvidence / bridgeStaysWithBiometrics — no new mining,
 * no new schema.
