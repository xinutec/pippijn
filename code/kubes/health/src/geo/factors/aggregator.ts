/**
 * Factor aggregator.
 *
 * Pure function: given a list of candidates, a context, and a list
 * of factors, runs each factor against each candidate and returns a
 * ScoredRefinement (best + alternatives + margin).
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 *   - Factors that return null are dropped from the candidate's
 *     `factors` breakdown — they contribute 0 to the total, AND they
 *     don't show up as "(no rationale)" entries in the eventual UI.
 *     This matters because "no biometric signature for this mode" is
 *     genuinely different from "biometric evidence against this mode."
 *   - Ranking is stable: ties are broken by input order, so the
 *     consumer can pre-sort candidates in a meaningful order (e.g.
 *     by geographical relevance) and have that order respected.
 *   - The aggregator does NO candidate generation. The consumer
 *     supplies candidates; the aggregator scores. Generators live
 *     elsewhere (each rule the current cascade replaces will get its
 *     own generator co-located with the cutover code).
 *   - Empty candidate list is a programming error, not an empty
 *     output — throws.
 *
 * Forward-load-bearing for two things:
 *
 *   1. The Phase 1 cutover in `refineMode`: refineMode produces
 *      candidates, calls scoreCandidates, returns the ScoredRefinement
 *      instead of today's flat (mode, confidence, reason, wayName).
 *   2. The Phase 3 explanation UI: the panel reads
 *      `EnrichedSegment.factorBreakdown: ScoredRefinement` and
 *      renders best + alternatives + their factor scores.
