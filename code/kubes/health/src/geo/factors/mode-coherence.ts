/**
 * mode-coherence factor.
 *
 * Scores the compatibility of a candidate's `mode` with its
 * `waySubtype` (the OSM tag value the candidate is attached to).
 *
 * Why a separate factor (not just inside osm-distance):
 *
 *   - osm-distance favours the closest way regardless of class.
 *     In urban areas a footway is frequently 5-10m closer than the
 *     real road, so on its own it would label fast driving as
 *     "near footway." The cascade-era rule for this was
 *     `pickBestHighway`; this factor is the scoring-era version.
 *   - Likewise a "train" candidate attached to a primary road
 *     should be penalised, regardless of distance.
 *
 * The score values are deliberately bounded log-likelihood-shaped
 * (±0.5 to ±3 nats). The magnitudes were chosen so the canonical
 * failure cases tested in `mode-coherence.test.ts` resolve
 * correctly when paired with `osm-distance` at urban-GPS distances.
 * Recalibration against fixture days is a Phase 2 / Phase 3 task.
