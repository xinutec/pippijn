/**
 * Constraint repair: the day-grammar's vehicle-handoff law, enforced.
 *
 * The grammar (`src/infer/day-grammar.ts`) says two *different* vehicles cannot
 * hand off directly — you can't step from one moving vehicle into another
 * without alighting. This pass is the critic that *repairs* that violation in
 * the timeline rather than merely flagging it.
 *
 * The case it fixes: a contiguous non-train vehicle leg handing straight off
 * to (or from) an identified `train` journey, with no walk/stop between. That
 * is not two vehicles — it is one rail journey, part of which was mislabelled.
 * Overwhelmingly this is the underground stretch where a tube runs *under* a
 * road: GPS surfaces onto the road, the segment snaps to "driving", and it sits
 * flush against the overground rail leg (the 2026-06-18 "driving on Euston
 * Underpass" → "Euston Square → Wembley Park" tube). Absorb the non-train leg
 * into the train.
 *
 * Conservative by construction: it fires ONLY on a contiguous hand-off (a real
 * park-and-ride has a walk or a GPS gap between car and platform, so it is
 * never contiguous) and ONLY into a train with a resolved board→alight
 * identity. It cannot invent a rail journey, only reclaim minutes flush against
 * one. Pure.
