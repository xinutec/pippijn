/**
 * Re-evaluate emitted stationary stays for hidden mid-stay departures,
 * using multi-signal weighted evidence. Companion to the segment-level
 * `unknown` mode emission (honest-gaps Phase 1) — together they pull
 * fabricated motion / over-merged stays back to what the data supports.
 *
 * `findStays` in `segments.ts` emits one stationary segment per spatial
 * cluster, but cannot tell from GPS alone whether a long gap between
 * two in-cluster fixes is "user stayed silently, phone went idle" or
 * "user briefly left and came back". Both patterns leave the same
 * trace: two clusters of in-place fixes bracketing a no-fix window.
 *
 * This pass combines four signals to estimate the likelihood of
 * mid-stay departure, then splits only when the evidence is strong
 * enough to warrant breaking the stay (and emits an `unknown` segment
 * in the gap so downstream rendering shows the departure honestly):
 *
 *   - **Biometric step count during the gap.** This is the *only*
 *     direct evidence of movement we have. Steps mid-gap = the user
 *     moved. Zero steps = the user sat. Drives the score on its own.
 *   - **Gap-anomaly ratio.** When the cluster has a dense pre-gap
 *     fix history, an anomalously long gap *amplifies* the step
 *     signal — but contributes nothing on its own. A long gap with
 *     no steps is the "phone died" pattern, not the "user left"
 *     pattern.
 *   - **HR during the gap.** Sustained elevation above resting
 *     baseline is supporting evidence of activity; restful HR is
 *     mild counter-evidence.
 *   - **Post-gap fix proximity.** A fix that lands back inside ~20 m
 *     of the cluster centroid is mild counter-evidence (the user
 *     returned to the exact same spot, more consistent with
 *     "didn't really leave").
 *
 * Calibration is deliberately conservative — the bias is toward NOT
 * splitting. A slight over-merge ("user was at hotel for 1h25m" when
 * they actually went out briefly) is far less misleading than a
 * fabricated split that breaks a quiet at-home evening into multiple
 * sub-stays. Cases where step data is too ambiguous to distinguish
 * "brief errand" from "sat silently" stay merged — the honest
 * "don't know" answer is to leave the data's ambiguity intact.
