/**
 * `ClassificationInputs` — the closure of inputs to the classification
 * pipeline for one (user, date).
 *
 * Phase 1 of `docs/proposals/2026-06-deterministic-fixtures.md`.
 *
 * The pipeline currently reads from a DB and the PhoneTrack HTTP API
 * at call time. That makes goldens non-deterministic: any of those
 * external states can drift between bless and check. The remedy is
 * to plumb every external read through a single typed value, so the
 * pipeline becomes `inputs → output` with no side fetches.
 *
 * Production loads this from the DB via `loadClassificationInputs`.
 * Tests load it from a captured fixture. Same pipeline, same value
 * shape, two sources.
 *
 * Phase 1 covers the eager loads that happen at the top of
 * `computeVelocity`:
 *
 *   - PhoneTrack fixes (three windows: today, next morning, prev evening)
 *   - Known places (focus_places projection used by snap)
 *   - Biometrics (HR, sleep, steps)
 *   - Per-user mode biometric signatures
 *
 * Later phases will add the lazy loads (OSM mirror, decoded_days,
 * rail_route_cache, presence_log) so the closure becomes complete.
 * The type evolves additively; callers consuming Phase 1 fields keep
 * working.
