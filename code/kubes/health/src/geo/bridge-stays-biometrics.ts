/**
 * Bridge stationary stays across short signal gaps using
 * biometric evidence. Implements the multi-signal-inference idea
 * surfaced by the 2026-05-22 Pizza Union case in the ground-truth
 * audit (#185): GPS data shows three separate stays at the same
 * coordinates because there's a brief no-fix gap mid-meal (likely
 * a toilet break); HR (resting) + steps (zero) for the gap window
 * tell us the user never actually moved.
 *
 * The function takes the segment pipeline's output + biometric
 * series, finds pairs of stationary segments that are:
 *
 *   - spatially co-located (centroids within COLOCATION_RADIUS_M)
 *   - separated by a gap shorter than MAX_GAP_SEC
 *   - covered by HR samples whose mean is at RESTING_HR_MAX or
 *     below, AND zero steps over the gap window
 *
 * and emits one merged stationary segment.
 *
 * The function is conservative by design: if HR data is missing
 * over the gap, OR steps were recorded during the gap, OR mean HR
 * is elevated, the pair is left as two separate stays. This is
 * weighted evidence ("we have positive signal that the user
 * didn't move"), not a gap-filling assumption.
 *
 * Why this lives outside `findStays`: findStays operates on raw
 * StayPoint clustering and runs before biometric attribution.
 * This pass runs after segmentation, after HR / steps have been
 * loaded for the day. It bridges stays that the geometry layer
 * had no information to merge.
