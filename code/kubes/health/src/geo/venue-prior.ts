/**
 * Venue-plausibility scoring for place naming (task #246).
 *
 * The old picker ranked `LANDMARK_PRIORITY[type] − distance/40m` — no notion
 * of whether a venue is open, whether anyone ever sits at that kind of venue
 * for 74 minutes, or whether *this user* ever visits that kind of venue at
 * all. The motivating failure: a meal-length 19:00 sit named after the
 * closed pharmacy 18 m from the smeared indoor-GPS centroid instead of the
 * open restaurant at 32 m.
 *
 * This module ranks candidates by summed log-evidence (nats), mirroring the
 * mode factor scorer:
 *
 *   distance   — Gaussian in metres (physical evidence; decisive at large
 *                gaps, gentle in the near field where GPS noise lives)
 *   venue      — a fixed offset for real venue types (amenity/tourism/shop)
 *                over areas (parks, squares, ways), worth ~1.5 nats: a venue
 *                beats an area at comparable distance but not across a large
 *                distance gap
 *   shape      — MINED visit-shape prior: log P(subtype) +
 *                log P(dwell bucket | subtype) + log P(hour | subtype),
 *                each relative to uniform, from the user's own stay history
 *                (`venue_type_priors`), with subtype → category → uniform
 *                backoff. No hand-tuned venue numbers — empty priors score
 *                exactly 0 everywhere.
 *   hours      — opening-hours evidence from the venue's OSM tag: open
 *                during the stay is weak support, closed is strong (but
 *                out-votable — OSM hours go stale; never a veto). A missing
 *                or unparseable tag is NO evidence.
 *
 * The one binary rule (`NEVER_DESTINATION_SUBTYPES`) is held to true
 * invariants: premises-less street furniture nobody can be "at" for a
 * 10-minute-plus stay. Anything with premises — however unlikely — is
 * weighted, not filtered.
