/**
 * In-memory cache for `/api/velocity` results.
 *
 * `computeVelocity` does a Nextcloud fetch + Kalman + segmentation +
 * OSM enrichment + biometric joins; on a data-rich day it takes
 * 5–10 seconds. Most of that work is deterministic for a given
 * `(user_id, date, tz)`, and the user typically revisits the same
 * day several times during a session (tab switches, chevron
 * navigation, refreshes). Caching the result in-process turns
 * those repeat views into ~50ms reads.
 *
 * Design choices:
 *
 *   - **Per-pod only.** Cleared on every process restart, which
 *     means a deploy automatically invalidates everything — no
 *     schema-version tag, no stale-cache-after-logic-change risk.
 *     The trade-off: cold cache after each deploy, so the first
 *     view of any day after deploy still pays the full compute.
 *
 *   - **Short TTL (5 min).** Today's date keeps accumulating new
 *     Owntracks pushes, and Fitbit sleep sync can land any time.
 *     A 5-minute window is short enough that the user sees fresh
 *     data within a fix-or-two of it arriving, and long enough
 *     that a typical session of tab-switching benefits.
 *
 *   - **LRU eviction at 32 entries.** Single user covers maybe a
 *     month of recently-visited days; 32 leaves headroom without
 *     unbounded growth.
 *
 *   - **In-flight dedup.** Two concurrent requests for the same
 *     key share a single computation. Without this, opening the
 *     dashboard in two tabs would trigger two parallel
 *     OSM-enrichment runs hitting the same DB rows.
 *
 *   - **Logs hit/miss to stdout.** So we can confirm the cache is
 *     working from `kubectl logs` without instrumenting the
 *     frontend.
