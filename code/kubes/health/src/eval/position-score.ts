/**
 * Position-level eval — the "source of truth test" for *where the line is
 * drawn*, the measurement foundation Phase 0 of
 * `docs/proposals/2026-06-map-constrained-positioning.md` calls for.
 *
 * Every map-positioning change we made on 2026-06-21 was unmeasurable: we
 * could only eyeball screenshots. This module scores a drawn track against
 * two ground-truth-light signals that between them capture every failure we
 * chased — and crucially need no hand-labelled road truth, just the fixes'
 * own accuracy field and the OSM road geometry:
 *
 *   1. **cross-track to the reliable-GPS reference** — the perpendicular
 *      distance from each drawn vertex to the polyline of the *good-accuracy*
 *      raw fixes. A good estimate follows the reliable fixes; the ±80 m
 *      Kalman swing (drawn point 80 m off the reliable track) shows up as a
 *      large cross-track. Low is good.
 *   2. **distance to the nearest drivable road** — catches a line drawn
 *      across non-road (the "through the buildings" / corner-cut failure).
 *      Low is good.
 *
 * A faithful map-constrained estimate scores low on BOTH. The raw track
 * scores 0 on (1) only where every fix is reliable, and badly on (2) where
 * the GPS is off-road; the current Kalman-smoothed line is hurt on (1) by
 * outlier swings. So the two numbers, tracked per change, tell better from
 * worse — which a screenshot cannot.
 *
 * Pure: no DB, no network. Deterministic given its inputs.
