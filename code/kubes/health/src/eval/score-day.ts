/**
 * Per-day scorer: compare a decoder's per-minute output against the
 * structured ground-truth rows from `parseGroundTruth`.
 *
 * The output is a triple of (mode-correctness, place-correctness,
 * line-correctness) — each with a `matching` and `scorable` count —
 * plus a per-row breakdown for human inspection. Only rows with
 * status `correct` contribute to scorable counts: those are the
 * minutes where the blessed cell IS the ground truth. Rows with
 * status `wrong` / `partial` / `unclear` are excluded — the human
 * `correctVersionText` is structured-text-free, so we can't reliably
 * score against it yet.
 *
 * Mode equivalence: `sleeping` and `stationary` are treated as the
 * same canonical class. Pipeline emits `sleeping` for night/in-bed
 * minutes; HSMM emits `stationary` with `inBed=true`. The scorer
 * accepts either against a ground-truth `sleeping` cell.
 *
 * Place resolution happens BEFORE this function — the caller passes
 * a `Map<placeName, focus_place_id>` so the scorer can compare ids
 * directly. Unresolved names (no entry in the map) are surfaced in
 * `unresolvedPlaceNames` so the human can either rename the focus
 * place or add an alias.
 *
 * Pure function. No DB, no IO, no globals.
