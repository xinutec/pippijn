/**
 * Truth-anchored route-correctness — the honest referee for a drawn walk, the
 * gate the off-walkable and corridor-stall proxies cannot be
 * (`docs/proposals/2026-07-true-path-reconstruction.md`, Phase 0).
 *
 * The confirmed ground-truth narratives name the street a walk ran along
 * ("walking on Barn Rise"). This measures what fraction of the DRAWN line's
 * length actually runs along that named street. The discriminating property:
 * it judges by NAME, not geometry, so
 *
 *   - an invented detour onto a *different* street drops the fraction (the
 *     failure class off-walkable-p90 rewards — the line hugs *a* pavement, just
 *     the wrong one), while
 *   - a genuine there-and-back on the SAME street keeps it high (the false
 *     positive that a corridor-stall gate would wrongly flag).
 *
 * It is a proxy, not perfect: the narrative names only the dominant street, so a
 * faithful walk that also crosses a connector scores below 1. It is therefore
 * used as a baseline-vs-candidate DELTA (did the change move more of the line
 * onto the wrong street?), not an absolute pass mark. Pure and deterministic.
