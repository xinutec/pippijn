/**
 * Journey-level scorer — the cutover gate the decoder-owns-mode program
 * depends on (`docs/proposals/decoder-roadmap.md`, measurement phase).
 *
 * `score-day.ts` scores per minute: it is brittle to a few minutes of
 * boundary misalignment (a train leg the decoder places at 15:35–15:38
 * against a ground-truth 15:30–15:38 scores most minutes wrong even when
 * the *leg* is right) and it says nothing about whether the day reads as
 * the right *sequence of trips*. This scorer works at the granularity a
 * human narrates a day: **journeys** (a run of movement bounded by stays),
 * each a sequence of **legs** (mode + transit line).
 *
 * It answers two questions the per-minute scorer can't:
 *
 *   1. **Leg fidelity** (boundary-robust) — for each ground-truth movement
 *      leg, did the decoder's *dominant* mode over that leg's window match,
 *      and for transit legs, the line? Dominant-over-window absorbs the few
 *      minutes of edge slop that sink the per-minute line score, while still
 *      honestly reporting a *genuinely* wrong mode (e.g. a train leg the
 *      decoder mostly calls walking stays a miss — this is not a fudge).
 *   2. **Trip structure** — did the decoder reconstruct each journey as the
 *      same ordered sequence of modes? (Did it merge two train legs into
 *      one, split one ride into two, or invent a leg?) This is the
 *      regression gate: a change that scrambles a trip's shape fails here
 *      even if per-minute mode accuracy is unchanged.
 *
 * Pure function. No DB, no IO, no globals. Consumes the same
 * `GroundTruthRow[]` and `DecoderMinute[]` as `score-day.ts`.
