/**
 * Walk-path plausibility — the single, tested source of truth for "how good is
 * this drawn walk", the scoring half of the truth-measurement loop (#296).
 *
 * All session the walk-quality signals were computed ad-hoc and scattered:
 * off-walkable / tortuosity / step-error in {@link scoreWalk} (drawn-path only),
 * corridor-stall inline in the render harness. This module unifies them into one
 * {@link WalkPlausibility} verdict — crucially adding the RAW-vs-matched
 * dimension `scoreWalk` lacks (it never sees the raw fixes), which is what
 * distinguishes an invented over-route from a faithful line.
 *
 * No single number is "truth" — each metric is confounded on its own (that is
 * the lesson of #293/#295). The point is to report them TOGETHER, per walk, so a
 * change is measured across every independent witness at once instead of tuned
 * against one proxy. Pure and deterministic.
