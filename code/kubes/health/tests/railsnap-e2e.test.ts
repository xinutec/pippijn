/**
 * Rail-snap end-to-end test — runs the station-anchored algorithm on a
 * real captured day.
 *
 * # Why this test is shaped like this
 *
 * The first rail-snap attempt shipped and was reverted three times with
 * every unit test green throughout. Those tests ran on synthetic routes
 * with fixes spread evenly along them; they never exercised the GPS
 * pathologies that actually broke production (platform dwell-clumps,
 * fixes that claim good accuracy but sit a kilometre off, coarse
 * cell-tower scatter). "Tests pass" carried no signal.
 *
 * This test runs the algorithm against a *real captured day*
 * (`capture-railsnap-fixture.ts` output): real GPS fixes, real
 * classified segments, real OSM rail geometry. It asserts outcome
 * *properties* a synthetic test structurally could not — most
 * importantly that the snapped path is not a degenerate blob (the
 * exact failure mode of the reverted attempt).
 *
 * The fixture lives in `tests/fixtures/railsnap/` and is gitignored
 * (real coordinates / journeys, local only — same policy as
 * `tests/fixtures/days/` and `tests/golden/`). When the fixture is
 * absent — i.e. on CI — the whole suite is skipped. Locally it runs on
 * every `npm test` and is the verdict on whether the feature works.
