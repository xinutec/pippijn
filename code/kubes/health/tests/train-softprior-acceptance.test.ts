 *
 * Replays the captured 2026-05-22 fixture through the *real* `decodeHsmm`
 * (the code path the prior was wired into) with NO database, then scores
 * the decode's line attribution against the user-confirmed ground-truth
 * narrative. The acceptance bar is the design's: the **line score rises
 * from 0/6** — before the prior, the decoder put a structurally-impossible
 * line on the underground minutes; the prior must pick a valid one.
 *
 * The fixture + ground-truth are gitignored (real coordinates / biometrics),
 * so this test SKIPS when the corpus is absent (CI), mirroring how
 * `golden-check-hsmm` exits 2 with no corpus. It is a local guard.
