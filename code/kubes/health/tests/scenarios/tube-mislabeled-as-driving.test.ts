/**
 * Scenario: a tube journey labelled as "driving on Trunk Road X"
 * because the rail line runs underneath a road and the legacy
 * `refineMode` cascade prefers the road over the rail at this
 * segment-summary speed.
 *
 * Reproduces today's production case (anonymised): the 21-minute
 * tube ride home was labelled "driving on Euston Underpass". The
 * segment had avgSpeed 27.4 km/h, maxSpeed 98.9 km/h. Bursts to
 * ~98 km/h are biomechanically + legally impossible on London
 * surface roads, but the segment-level avg is in driving range.
 *
 * This test calls `refineMode` directly with synthesised NearbyWay
 * data shaped like the prod situation: a trunk highway (the surface
 * road) and a subway rail line (the underground tube) both near the
 * segment's path.
 *
 * Phase 1 (this test, RED): legacy cascade picks driving. Document
 * the bug; expectation = train.
 *
 * Phase 2 (follow-up): turn on factor scorer (USE_FACTOR_SCORER=1)
 * AND extend refineMode's call site to pass maxSpeed in addition
 * to avgSpeed -- the speed-emission factor needs to see the 98 km/h
 * burst to rule driving out.
