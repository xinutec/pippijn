/**
 * Scenario: a tube ride where the segment classifier ends the train
 * segment too early — at a brief Kalman-detected stop mid-ride —
 * causing the alighting-station picker to label the segment with the
 * mid-ride station instead of the user's actual disembarking station.
 *
 * Reproduces today's production case (anonymised, but the geometry
 * matches): user took the tube from station A to station E. The
 * classifier ended the train segment at station C (a brief 1-minute
 * dwell mid-ride looked like the end). The alighting-station picker
 * found the first slow fix after that endTs — landing at station C —
 * and labelled the segment "A -> C" even though the train continued
 * for another 3 km to station E.
 *
 * The realistic fix-data sample (from prod):
 *   - cruise speeds 30-87 km/h
 *   - brief stop at (mid-ride station) — speed drops to 2.6 km/h
 *   - cruise resumes (52, 59 km/h)
 *   - another brief stop — speed 1.1 km/h
 *   - cruise again
 *   - final stop at (actual disembark) — walking pace
 *
 * Behaviour under test: the post-train fix sequence should be parsed
 * such that intermittent stops are recognised as mid-ride dwells (not
 * the final alight), and the labelled alight station is the one
 * where the user actually starts walking away from the rail line.
