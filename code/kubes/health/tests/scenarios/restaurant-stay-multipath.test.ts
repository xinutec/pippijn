/**
 * Scenario: a continuous stay at a single place gets split into two
 * stays + a phantom "walking" segment when GPS multipath produces
 * an outlier mid-stay. The user never left the table.
 *
 * Reproduces today's production case (location anonymised): the
 * pipeline produced
 *   stationary @ Place X (20 min)
 *   walking on Some Street (5 min, "re-classified by biometric signature")
 *   stationary @ Place X (47 min)
 * where the user reported a single 72-min stay with no walk-out-and-back.
 *
 * The realistic fix-data sample (probed live from prod):
 *   - 20+ fixes clustered at the table centroid, speeds 0.0-1.3 km/h
 *   - 1-2 multipath spikes: one fix ~70 m N of centroid at 5.6 km/h,
 *     another fix ~40 m E of centroid at 5.8 km/h, both followed by
 *     a snap back to the table
 *   - Rest of fixes back at the table
 *
 * `classifySegments` reads "movement" from the spikes and emits a
 * walking segment between two stays. `mergeAdjacentStays` currently
 * only collapses DIRECTLY-adjacent stays at the same place — it
 * doesn't bridge a brief intervening segment.
