/**
 * `stationsOnLine` — given a named rail line, return the set of
 * stations that line serves.
 *
 * The HMM hard-zero transition rule "line L cannot serve focus place
 * P" depends on this lookup. Today's `linesAtPoint` answers the
 * inverse (which lines run near a given point); the membership
 * direction requires either ingesting OSM relation members (not
 * currently mirrored) or inferring from spatial proximity between
 * station points and the line's way geometry.
 *
 * This module uses the spatial-proximity inference because the local
 * OSM mirror already has both osm_lines (rail-line ways with name)
 * and osm_points (stations with railway tag). Tests pin the pure
 * `filterStationsByLineProximity` helper; the DB-backed `stationsOnLine`
 * is exercised via the helper.
