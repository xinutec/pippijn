/**
 * Classification snapshot — the committable CI net for the
 * scored-classification migration (#103).
 *
 * Each scenario is a synthetic day driven through the full
 * `computeVelocityFromInputs` core; the test pins the per-segment
 * `(mode, wayName)` sequence with an inline snapshot. Every scenario runs
 * under BOTH flag states:
 *
 *   - "legacy cascade"   — `USE_FACTOR_SCORER` unset (today's production)
 *   - "factor scorer ON" — `USE_FACTOR_SCORER=1` (the migration target)
 *
 * The paired snapshots are the migration's calibration instrument: the
 * legacy column is the frozen baseline, the scorer column shows what
 * flipping the flag would do, and a diff in either is an explicit,
 * reviewable segment-level change rather than a silent shift in the
 * rendered timeline. The canonical reason the migration exists:
 *
 *   - a motorised leg hugging a rail line with no road near → train
 *   - the same speed on a road with no rail near            → driving
 *
 * Speed alone can't separate them; only the map (the rail-corridor
 * factor, live only under the flag) can.
