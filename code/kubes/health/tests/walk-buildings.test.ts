/**
 * `buildingCrossingM` — the headline referee metric the off-walkable proxy is
 * blind to. It measures how much of the DRAWN line's length lies inside a
 * building footprint. Yesterday's snapped Wembley line cut a diagonal chord
 * across a building block and still scored well on off-walkable-p90 (a chord on a
 * way centreline is "near a way"); this metric is what makes that defect visible.
