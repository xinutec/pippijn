/**
 * Tests for `bestPlace` reading OSM lookups via an `OsmAdapter`.
 *
 * Phase 6d of `docs/proposals/2026-06-deterministic-fixtures.md`.
 *
 * Pre-Phase-6d, `bestPlace` directly imports `nearbyLandmarks` and
 * `reverseGeocode` from `osm.ts` — there is no way to inject either,
 * so these tests can't even compile. The refactor's contract is what
 * these tests pin down:
 *
 *   - `bestPlace(osm, lat, lon, opts)` takes an `OsmAdapter` as its
 *     first parameter and reads OSM/Nominatim only through it.
 *   - The behaviour rules tested here mirror what the prod
 *     implementation already does. If those rules later change, the
 *     test changes with the rule; the *threading* (adapter is
 *     consulted at the right points) stays load-bearing.
 *
 * Real-data behaviour parity is verified by the golden suite, not
 * here. These tests cover the surface — adapter is wired, the rules
 * route to the right adapter primitives.
