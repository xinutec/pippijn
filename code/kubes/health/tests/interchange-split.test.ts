/**
 * Interchange decomposition (task #222).
 *
 * A train segment whose board/alight stations share no common line is
 * physically impossible as one ride (#181's validity constraint). The
 * motivating leg: a journey home rendered as ONE train between two
 * stations on disjoint lines, while the watch recorded the interchange
 * walk mid-gap (walk–pause–walk step burst) and GPS was dark underground.
 *
 * Decomposition evidence:
 *   - the burst times the change;
 *   - the interchange station is a station on BOTH a line serving the
 *     board end and a line serving the alight end;
 *   - among candidates, timing picks: expected arrival ≈ leg start +
 *     boarding wait + distance-derived ride time. (Validated against the
 *     user's confirmed change: the timing fit chose correctly where
 *     resurfacing geometry could not — parallel corridors.)
 *
 * All stations/coordinates here are synthetic, anchored at (50.0, 5.0).
