/**
 * `upgradeTubeHops` rescues a short, clean-GPS Underground hop that slipped
 * past the underground-reconstruction gates (which need ≥180 s and *coarse*
 * cell-tower fixes) and got carved out as a `driving` leg by vehicleSplit —
 * leaving the bus matcher as the only thing that can label it. The real case
 * (2026-06-29): Euston Square → Baker Street on the sub-surface line, ~35 km/h,
 * mislabelled "bus 18" because route 18 shares the Marylebone Road corridor.
 *
 * The rule: a *motorised* leg whose board + alight fixes both resolve to
 * stations sharing at least one Underground line, AND whose average speed is
 * above sustained central-London bus pace, is a tube — upgrade it to `train`
 * (which makes it ineligible for the bus passes). Speed is the bus/tube
 * discriminator on a shared corridor; the station-pair is the "it's a rail
 * corridor at all" gate. Synthetic coords, no DB/OSM.
