/**
 * `applyHsmmPlaceOverride` is the integration glue between the
 * HSMM's place picks (from `decoded_days`) and the heuristic
 * pipeline's segments. For each pipeline stationary segment, it
 * finds the dominant HSMM placeId across the segment's minutes and
 * overrides the segment's `place` display name when the HSMM is
 * confident.
 *
 * Pure function — tested with synthetic segments + name lookup
 * tables, no DB or live data.
