/**
 * Per-minute mode-class lock — universal physical facts used to
 * narrow the decoder's hypothesis space upstream of scoring.
 *
 * Three locks, all derived from sustained signal across a 5-minute
 * window so a single noisy minute doesn't flip the verdict:
 *
 *   - **"foot"**: the watch reports sustained cadence above the
 *     walking threshold. Feet are moving in the user's reference
 *     frame. The user cannot simultaneously be in a moving vehicle
 *     or stationary.
 *   - **"vehicle"**: GPS displacement across the window implies a
 *     speed above the walking ceiling, AND no sustained cadence.
 *     The user is moving but not on foot. (Could be train, drive,
 *     bike — the mode-class lock doesn't disambiguate within the
 *     class.)
 *   - **"stationary"**: GPS observations cluster tightly across
 *     the window AND there's no sustained cadence.
 *
 * Otherwise: null (the lock is silent and the scorer decides).
 *
 * These thresholds are universal human-physiology / GPS-noise
 * facts, not user-specific: a human cannot sustain > 12 km/h
 * walking; > 30 spm wrist cadence is sustained walking; an 80 m
 * cluster spread is within consumer-GPS noise for stationary
 * activity.
