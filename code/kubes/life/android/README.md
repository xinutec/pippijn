# life web viewer (Android)

The `life.xinutec.org` app (the personal home-OS) presented as a native-feeling
app: a single full-screen **WebView**, no address bar, no tabs, a home-screen icon.
It avoids browser chrome while showing the UI exactly as designed (the system
WebView is Chromium, so it renders like Chrome).

The site is **behind a login** (Nextcloud identity — a self-hosted IdP that works in
a WebView). The WebView keeps the session cookie, so it's a **one-time sign-in**; the
app needs only `INTERNET`.

## What it does

- Loads `https://life.xinutec.org/` — **hardcoded** (`MainActivity.LIFE_URL`); this
  app is single-purpose.
- JavaScript + DOM storage on (Angular), all navigation kept in-app, Back walks the
  SPA history.
- Insets the WebView from the system bars by padding a wrapper, and paints the
  strips behind the bars with the page's own surface colour (read on load, so it
  tracks the Material light/dark theme). The WebView no longer underlaps the bars,
  so the page's own `env(safe-area-inset-*)` collapse to 0 and add nothing on top.

Runs on any Android 8+ (minSdk 26) device.

## Build & install

No toolchain lives in this repo — it borrows the recall project's `android` nix
dev shell (JDK 17 + Android SDK; the Gradle wrapper pins Gradle):

```sh
cd android
nix develop ~/Code/recall#android --command ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
# → app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Install onto a phone over WiFi (Pixel 9 is at `192.168.1.133:5555`):

```sh
ADB="$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb"   # inside the nix shell above
"$ADB" connect 192.168.1.133:5555
"$ADB" -s 192.168.1.133:5555 install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
"$ADB" -s 192.168.1.133:5555 shell am start -n org.xinutec.life/.MainActivity
```

The APK is signed with the auto-generated debug key — fine for sideloading, the
only distribution path.
