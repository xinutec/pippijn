 * L2 phone-width layout harness for messages. Render the two real screens (the
 * conversation-list shell and an open thread) at a Pixel viewport with the
 * backend mocked and BUSY data, and assert the two failure classes that read
 * fine in source and only show on a real phone:
 *   1. no two pieces of rendered text collide, and
 *   2. nothing spills past the right edge.
 * The at-risk spots here: the three-button origin filter row (All / Signal /
 * Google Chat) crowding at 412px, and a message's meta line (sender + time +
 * "edited") and reaction chips overflowing or overlapping the body.
 *
 * There is no service worker in this app, but block it anyway for parity with
 * the fleet's layout specs — SW-controlled fetches would bypass page.route.
