  # @angular/build:application tears down its Piscina worker pool at process

  # the process — a libuv kqueue assertion ("errno == EINTR", uv__io_poll →
  # Abort 6) or "EBADF: bad file descriptor, close" — AFTER "bundle generation
  # complete". NG_BUILD_MAX_WORKERS=1 lowers the rate (fewer worker pipes to
  # race) but does NOT eliminate it; a spurious build abort here is worked
  # around by re-running verify. Harmless on Linux/CI, which build cleanly.
